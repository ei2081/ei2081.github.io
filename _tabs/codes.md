## Q-Codes
Although Q-codes were created when radio used Morse code exclusively, they continued to be employed after the introduction of voice transmissions.

This page is a test for a quickly searchable (via the theme used) reference of Q-Codes<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>, with a focus on their use in amateur radio<sup>1</sup>. They may also be referred to as "Q Signals"<sup>5</sup>.

### ITU Q Codes
When using q-codes, there are various modifiers which can be use to clarify when the use is a statement, a question or a affirmative or negative reply [<sup>1</sup>](https://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/R-REC-M.1172-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf)

- The QOA to QQZ series are reserved for the maritime mobile service.

These may be a statement, or a question. I've omitted some, as have other reference, like `QSD` which could be "mutilated signals" or "defective keying", very different perhaps ? Some others make seem of limited use, but that may change when you consider disaster / emergency conditions ?

> During your on-the-air contacts, use the Q code (attachment 2) correctly. Avoid overkill by using the Q code all the time in phone. You can also use standard expressions that everybody understands. 
> Some Q codes have however become standard expressions even in phone, e.g.:
