## Q-Codes
This post is a test for a quickly searchable (via the theme used) reference of Q-Codes[<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>](#references), with a focus on their use in amateur radio[<sup>1</sup>](#references). 
They may also be referred to as "Q Signals"[<sup>5</sup>](#references).

**Morse code** is the focus, they originated when it was the only show in town. *However* some q-codes seeped into voice transmissions and have become commonplace. (Overuse in voice not recommended.)
 
### ITU Q Codes (subset)
When using q-codes, they may be a statement, or a question. Various modifiers may be used to clarify when a statement, a question or an affirmative / negative reply [<sup>1</sup>](#references)

> The QOA to QQZ series are reserved for the maritime mobile service.

Here below is a subset, which can probably be further trimmed for common-use codes.

- Those marked with "<sup>H</sup>" are in scope for the HAREC exam [<sup>6</sup>](#references)
