# Raspberry PI Models

We have two Pi micro computers (or "single board computers" ) right now which we plan to try with the RTL SDR Blog V4.
- [Pi Model B](#raspberry-pi-model-b-rev2)
- [Pi 3 Model B+](#raspberry-pi-3-b-r13)

## Raspberry PI Model B Rev2 

The first is an old 2011 _"Raspberry PI Rev 2 Model B"_. Over the years it has run a demo website with dynamic dns serving, a media player and some retro games. Various operating system have graced its memory cards including Raspian, Debian, Arch and even RISCOS. 

It may not be up to spec to run the [RTL SDR V4]({% post_url 2024-08-27-rtl-sdr-blog-v4 %}) but we will have a go.

At the time of writing there are two cards for it with installs that haven't been touched in a while, updates may well be on the cards. They are both running Debian `Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)`. One with a UI and one without, terminal only. Specific version via `cat /etc/debian_version` = `10.13`


### Hardware Ref
This model is one of the earlier Raspberry Pi devices. Initially I couldn't find it on the Pi site - it does not show up on [the RaspberryPi.com products page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/). But it does show up [on this documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html) page.

### PCB Markings/Text

on the top of the board, text other than component ids/numbers includes
- under the Raspberry logo
    > "Raspberry Pi (c) 2011.12"
- a sticker at the edge
    > "Made in China" 
- Not much else, icons for the "CE" and "FCC" logos.
